Murder & Madnes is my project for Code Louisville Web Dev session one Jan 2022.

Murder & Madness is a true crime blog, which will eventually be set up to include things like news articles, podcast episodes, as well as photo and video content. 

Features:

The website uses a combination of CSS Grid and FlexBox to layout the content. Flexbox and media queries are utilized to change how content is viewed at different screen sizes.

The navigation menu uses Javascript to show and hide the menu content on click.

The contact form validates the email field for proper email format and uses Javascript to display the message that has been sent when the form is submitted.
